#+TITLE: Ideas for the libcppSocket library

* Classes/interfaces/behaviors
** AddressNameMapper
  * Already mostly implemented
  * May need to expand upon the getIPAddr method to return multiple results
  * Handles the gethostname and getipaddress roles
  * Probabaly could make this class private

** IMessage
  * Generic Interface for messages sent by sockets

** HTTPMessage
  * implements IMessage
*** PUT
*** DELETE
*** GET
** Generic Socket
  * possibly differentiate between TCP and UDP?
** UDPSocket
  * Currently un-implemented
** TCPSocket
*** Generic methods
**** Create ()
**** Close ()
**** Send ( IMessage )
    * returns another IMessage, (ie response)
    * a message to client, or possibly server
    * could be a request or response HTTP message

*** Server-socket methods
**** Bind - ( port and host )
**** Listen
**** Accept
   * accept connection from client

*** Client-socket methods
**** Connect( host, portNumber )
    * params: host and port number(local port)
